### Minimal Example
Here's a minimal example of using the QLIF neuron layer in PyTorch:
```python
import torch
from qlif_layers.qlif_layer import QLIFLayer

# (T, B, N)
T, B, N = 100, 1, 128
inp = torch.randn(T, B, N)

layer = QLIFLayer(
    num_neurons=N,
    V_th=1.5,
    tau=30.0,
    stochastic=True,
    noise_std=0.05,
    use_adaptive_threshold=True,
    quantum_mode=True,           # default is True to enable QLIF (qubit-based)
).to("cpu")                      # or "cuda" for GPU

spikes, voltages = layer(inp)    # spikes: (T,B,N) bool / voltages: (T,B,N) float
```

## Overview

In classical LIF neurons, spike decisions are 
either **deterministic** (hard threshold) or **pseudo-stochastic** through additive noise.  
**QLIF** replaces this thresholding step with a **single-qubitâ€“based mapping**:

### Key features include:

- **Adaptive Thresholds** (refractory/homeostasis)
- **Neuromodulation** (`gain`, `threshold-shift`, `prob-slope`)
- **Short-term Plasticity** (depression/recovery)
- **Dynamic Spike Probability** (self-limiting)
- **QLIF Mode** (qubit-inspired spike decision)

This framework not only allows for comprehensive simulations and comparisons of spiking behaviors across 
different neuron types but also facilitates the integration of biologically inspired and quantum-inspired 
dynamics into modern machine learning workflows.

*All standard LIF parameters like V_th, tau, noise_std, etc. are still supported and work identically in quantum mode.*

### How It Works

#### Classic vs. Quantum Spike Generation

- **Classic Mode**: Spike is generated by crossing a voltage threshold, optionally with noise or adaptive dynamics.

- **Quantum Mode**: Each neuron's membrane potential is encoded as a quantum rotation (RY(V)), plus a "leak" rotation, and the spike is triggered if the measured Qubit is below a tunable quantum threshold.
This introduces a true quantum-inspired, probabilistic decision process.

#### Input Processing

- **I (Input Current):** The neuron receives a raw current, which is the primary drive.
- **External Modulation:** Optionally, an external signal (e.g., representing a reward or dopamine level) is provided.
  This signal is transformed (using a user-defined `neuromod_transform` or a default sigmoid) to produce a modulation
  factor that influences neuronal excitability.

#### Effective Input Calculation

The raw input is modified by internal dynamic factors:

- **Synaptic Efficiency:** Scales down the input if previous spikes have occurred (modeling synaptic depression).
- **Neuromodulator:** Adds a context-dependent boost (or reduction) to excitability.
- **Adaptation Current:** Subtracts from the input to account for refractory periods after spiking.

The effective input is computed as:

```math
I_{effective} = I * synaptic_{efficiency} + neuromodulator - adaptation_{current}
```

#### Membrane Potential Update

- The neuron's membrane potential ``V`` is updated based on the effective input, time constant tau, and any noise (if
  stochastic mode is enabled).
- When ``V`` exceeds the adaptive threshold ``V_th``, a spike is generated.
- In deterministic (non-stochastic) mode, a hard threshold is applied; in stochastic mode, a probability is computed (
  either static or dynamic) and a spike is sampled.

#### Spike Generation & Reset

- If a spike occurs, ``V`` is reset to ``V_reset``.
- The model then updates internal states:
- Adaptation Current: Increases for spiking neurons and decays over time.
- Synaptic Efficiency: Depresses upon spiking and recovers gradually.
- Adaptive Threshold (``V_th``): Adjusts (increases upon spiking and decays when inactive).

## Quantum Mode, Theory, Mapping & Calibration

This project implements a **qubit-inspired spike generator** for LIF neurons.  
The goal is a **differentiable, calibrated, and vectorized** probabilistic spike mechanism that can be trained end-to-end, while being grounded in a simple quantum circuit model.

### 1) One-Qubit Circuit (what we actually compute)

I use a single qubit with a rotation about the Y axis and measure `Z`:

```
prepare |0> --RY(Î¸)--> measure Z
```

The probability of measuring `|1>` is:

```
p(|1>) = sinÂ²(Î¸/2) = 0.5 * (1 - cos Î¸)
```

### 2) Mapping the membrane gap Î” to Î¸

Then map the neuron's **membrane gap**:

```
Î” = V - V_th
```

and map it linearly to the rotation angle:

```
Î¸ = Î± Â· Î” + Î²
p = 0.5 * (1 - cos Î¸)
```
- **Î± = q_scale** (learnable if `learnable_qscale=True`)
- **Î² = q_bias; quantum_leak** (learnable if `learnable_qbias=True`)

This is computed in `_quantum_prob` using the shared helper `q_spike_prob(Î”, Î±, Î²)`.  
The mapping is **periodic** in Î” because of the cosine, this is intentional here and 
matches the original 1-qubit model. If strict monotonicity 
is desired, a squashing function (e.g. sigmoid) can be applied 
before scaling Î¸ (not used in the current default).

---

### 3) Why monotonic mapping?

Instead of adjusting `V_th` to control base firing rates, we calibrate Î± and Î² directly so that:

- **Baseline firing probability** at Î” = 0 matches a target `pâ‚€` (e.g. 0.02)
- **Local slope** `sâ‚€ = (âˆ‚p/âˆ‚Î”)|Î”=0` matches a target value (e.g. 0.10)

```
p(Î”) = 0.5 * (1 - cos(Î±Î” + Î²))
```
```
Î² = arccos(1 - 2pâ‚€)
Î± = (2 Â· sâ‚€) / sin(Î²)
```
In code (`init_quantum`):
```python
eps = 1e-6
beta = torch.acos(torch.clamp(1.0 - 2.0 * torch.tensor(p0), -1.0 + eps, 1.0 - eps))
alpha = (2.0 * torch.tensor(slope0)) / torch.clamp(torch.sin(beta), min=eps)

with torch.no_grad():
  self.q_bias.fill_(float(beta + self.quantum_leak))
  self.q_scale.fill_(float(alpha))
```
